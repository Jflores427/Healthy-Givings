Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."

You can freeze all your bones until you're ready to use them, it'd be a shame to throw them out!",

If it's too firm, it's not ripe. If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!",

This has allowed the vibrant fruit to show through beautifully with lively lime and lemon aromas and a flinty, mineral edginess with hints of fig and white peach.The weighty mid-palate also shows peachy ripeness along with crisp acid minerality that gives the wine a refreshing cleansing quality. This wine is delightful as an aperitif, and even better to drink with fish and shellfish.",

Skipping this step could result in bitter, even soapy tasting quinoa because quinoa's natural coating tastes pretty bad. Quinoa sold in supermarkets is often pre-rinsed, but its better to be safe than sorry, right?",

Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is brown rice stripped of some of its parts and much of its fiber and other nutrients. It is important to note, however, that all rice types raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation. In fact, if it seems like it would work in the recipe, the best option would probably be so-called <a href=\"http://spoonacular.com/Another-(simpler)-Version-Of-Cauliflower-Rice-30679\">cauliflower rice</a>.",

Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.",
                "Since most of its calories come from fat, sour cream has a bad reputation for being an unhealthy food. However, <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> is an important part of the diet and studies suggest people who eat full fat dairy <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/02/12/275376259/the-full-fat-paradox-whole-milk-may-keep-us-lean\">are thinner</a> than those who reach for reduced fat products. That said, fat has more calories per gram than carbohydrates or protein, so if you are counting calories to lose weight, you might want to try substituting greek yogurt for some of the sour cream in recipes that call for a lot of it."

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

Cover the chicken with plastic wrap and press down so the marinade will soak the chicken evenly. Refrigerate for 1 hour.\nWhile waiting for the chicken to marinate, prepare the vegetables. Chop the onion into square pieces. Chop green onions and separate the white and green parts. Zest the orange.\nIn a saut pan, add vegetable oil and turn to high heat. Add in the chicken and saut for 1 minute. Toss the chicken and saut for another minute or until caramelized. Transfer the chicken to a dish.\nContinue to use high heat. Add the chopped onion to the pan and saut until soft. Add the chicken back to the pan, with the white parts of the green onion and orange zest. Cook for about 30 seconds. Add the liquid to the pan and let it simmer to 30 seconds. Add the remaining green onion to the pan and let the sauce continue to reduce and thicken.\nWhen the sauce is reduced to desired consistency, add salt and pepper to taste. The orange chicken is done. Serve over white rice.",

Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is brown rice stripped of some of its parts and much of its fiber and other nutrients. It is important to note, however, that all rice types raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation. In fact, if it seems like it would work in the recipe, the best option would probably be so-called <a href=\"http://spoonacular.com/Another-(simpler)-Version-Of-Cauliflower-Rice-30679\">cauliflower rice</a>.",

You're only gaining a little fat for a lot of flavor. Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too. So in our opinion: dig in, skin and all!",

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side.

The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.",
